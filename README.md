# Welcome to the Nuada codebase
##### [WIP]: Navigate to each directory under ```/src``` to see more specialized READMEs

### Getting Started
Clone this remote repo into your local device. If you have been assigned an issue, locally checkout the development branch for that issue.

### Taking on an Issue
To access your assigned issues, navigate to the ```Issues``` tab in the resource bar, and filter by assignee by selecting the ```Assignee``` dropdown.<br />

When you are ready, on the issue page, click on the hyperlink in ```Development```. Keep the branch name unchanged, but keep note of it as that will be your development branch. Then, copy the popup commands into your local repository, while within the root directory. If you lose them, they are:
```
git fetch origin
git checkout <name of branch>
```
Commit and push your work for that issue onto the issue-specific branch.
